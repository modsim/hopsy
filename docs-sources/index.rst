:doc:`hopsy <index>` is a scientific Python tool for Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling on convex polytopes of the form

.. math:: \mathcal{P} := \{ x : Ax \leq b \},

a problem that often arises in 
`Bayesian metabolic flux analysis <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.26379>`_.
It is built using `pybind11 <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ 
and works on the powerful C++ polytope sampling tool 
`HOPS <https://modsim.github.io/hops/doxygen/index.html>`_.
Its goal is to combine the efficiency of the C++-backend with the flexibility of the Python language whilst
maintaining a comprehensible API and interoperability with other Python libraries.

:doc:`hopsy <index>` offers not only a magnitude of efficiently implemented algorithms specialized for sampling 
linearily constrained spaces, but also allows for implementing custom samplers in C++.
Similarily, besides providing a few test :doc:`models<userguide/problem>`, :doc:`hopsy <index>` allows sampling
user-implemented models.
A few examples including :math:`^{13}\mathrm{C}`-metabolic flux analysis, bioreactor kinetics, 
statistical physics simulations and a SIR-model can be found in the examples section.

An important task, especially when sampling expensive to evaluate target functions, is tuning
of the proposal's hyperparameters.
:doc:`hopsy <index>` offers a Thompson Sampling-based approach which can perform tuning based on different objective
functions.
Please refer to :doc:`this chapter<userguide/tuning>` for more information.

    <h2>Quick Start</h2>


**Installation** using pip

.. code::

   pip3 install hopsy

**Code example**

.. code::

   import hopsy
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   problem = hopsy.Problem([[1, 1], [-1, 0], [0, -1]], [1, 0, 0])

   chain = hopsy.MarkovChain(problem, starting_point=[.5, .5])
   rng = hopsy.RandomNumberGenerator(seed=42)

   accrate, samples = hopsy.sample(chain, rng, n_samples=1000, thinning=10)
